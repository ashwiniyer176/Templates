    <div class="text-element">
      <h3><b>Head</b></h3>
      <p>
        The upper part of the human body, or the front or upper part of the body
        of an animal, typically separated from the rest of the body by a neck,
        and containing the brain, mouth, and sense organs.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-element">
      <h3><b>Ears</b></h3>
      <p>
        The ear is the organ of hearing and, in mammals, balance. In mammals,
        the ear is usually described as having three parts—the outer ear, the
        middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna and
        the ear canal.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-element">
      <h3><b>Mouth</b></h3>
      <p>
        The mouth is an oval-shaped cavity inside the skull. The two main
        functions of the mouth are eating and speaking. Parts of the mouth
        include the lips, vestibule, mouth cavity, gums, teeth, hard and soft
        palate, tongue and salivary glands. The mouth is also known as the oral
        cavity or the buccal cavity.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-element">
      <h3><b>Cheeks</b></h3>
      <p>
        The cheeks (Latin: buccae) constitute the area of the face below the
        eyes and between the nose and the left or right ear. "Buccal" means
        relating to the cheek. In humans, the region is innervated by the buccal
        nerve. The area between the inside of the cheek and the teeth and gums
        is called the vestibule or buccal pouch or buccal cavity and forms part
        of the mouth. In other animals the cheeks may also be referred to as
        jowls.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-element">
      <h3><b>Elbow</b></h3>
      <p>
        The elbow is the visible joint between the upper and lower parts of the
        arm. It includes prominent landmarks such as the olecranon, the elbow
        pit, the lateral and medial epicondyles, and the elbow joint.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-element">
      <h3><b>Arm</b></h3>
      <p>
        In human anatomy, the arm is the part of the upper limb between the
        glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) and the elbow joint. In common
        usage, the arm extends through the hand. It can be divided into the
        upper arm, which extends from the shoulder to the elbow, the forearm
        which extends from the elbow to the hand, and the hand. Anatomically the
        shoulder girdle with bones and corresponding muscles is by definition a
        part of the arm.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-element">
      <h3><b>Hand</b></h3>
      <p>
        A hand is a prehensile, multi-fingered appendage located at the end of
        the forearm or forelimb of primates such as humans, chimpanzees,
        monkeys, and lemurs. A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which
        has two opposable thumbs on each "hand" and fingerprints extremely
        similar to human fingerprints) are often described as having "hands"
        instead of paws on their front limbs. The raccoon is usually described
        as having "hands" though opposable thumbs are lacking.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-element">
      <h3><b>Knee</b></h3>
      <p>
        In humans and other primates, the knee joins the thigh with the leg and
        consists of two joints: one between the femur and tibia (tibiofemoral
        joint), and one between the femur and patella (patellofemoral joint).[1]
        It is the largest joint in the human body.[2] The knee is a modified
        hinge joint, which permits flexion and extension as well as slight
        internal and external rotation. The knee is vulnerable to injury and to
        the development of osteoarthritis.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-element">
      <h3><b>Shin</b></h3>
      <p>
        Tibia, also called shin, inner and larger of the two bones of the lower
        leg in vertebrates—the other is the fibula. In humans the tibia forms
        the lower half of the knee joint above and the inner protuberance of the
        ankle below.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-element">
      <h3><b>Foot</b></h3>
      <p>
        The foot is the lowermost point of the human leg. The foot's shape,
        along with the body's natural balance-keeping systems, make humans
        capable of not only walking, but also running, climbing, and countless
        other activities.
